I want to transform this entire frontend to look like similar to the blinkit clone but make sure this follows everything as per swagger doc which is in C:\Users\husain.burhanpurwala\Downloads\blinkit_clone\docs\api\swagger-complete.yaml make sure all the color pallets are everything are as per blinkit but name this web-app as GroFast everywhere use GroFast not blinkit.
Goal: Generate a Blinkit-inspired grocery delivery web app using Next.js, fully integrated with the GroFast OpenAPI 3.0.3 backend.

Overview

Build a fast, mobile-first, category-driven grocery shopping experience similar to Blinkit, using the provided OpenAPI specification. The frontend must be built with Next.js 14+ (App Router) and reflect Blinkit's clean UX, real-time cart, product grid, and seamless checkout flow.

All API interactions must follow the security and validation rules defined in the spec (Firebase JWT, request/response schemas).

Technical Stack

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
Language: TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
State & API: React Query (@tanstack/react-query)
Forms: React Hook Form + Zod
Icons: lucide-react
Routing: next/navigation
Auth: Firebase JWT via Authorization: Bearer <token>

UI/UX Requirements (Blinkit-Like)

Home Page (/)
- Hero banner with search bar
- Horizontal scrollable category pills (e.g., Fruits & Vegetables, Snacks, Dairy)
- "Trending Now" or "Top Picks" product grid (2–3 columns on mobile)
- Floating mini-cart at bottom-right with item count and total

Category Page (/categories/1)
- Breadcrumb: Home > Fruits & Vegetables
- Grid of products (2 per row on mobile, 3 on desktop)
- Each product shows:
  - Image
  - Name
  - Price (with strikethrough original_price if discounted)
  - + button → adds to cart; changes to quantity selector after add

Cart (/cart)
- Persistent floating cart bar at bottom (like Blinkit)
- Click → opens slide-up drawer (CartDrawer)
- Shows:
  - List of items with name, price, quantity (+/– buttons)
  - Subtotal, delivery fee, total
  - "Proceed to Checkout" button

Checkout (/orders/create)
- Form fields:
  - Delivery address (from auth/me or input)
  - Time slot dropdown (9-11, 11-13, etc.)
  - Payment method (cash, card, upi, wallet)
  - Special instructions (optional)
- Show order summary
- On submit → call POST /orders/create

Orders Page (/orders/my-orders)
- List of past orders
- Each order shows:
  - Order number
  - Status badge (Delivered, Out for Delivery, etc.)
  - Total amount
  - Delivery time
- Click → view details (/orders/12345)

API Integration

Use the OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec to generate a type-safe API client. Recommended tools:
- Orval → Generate React Query hooks
- OpenAPI Generator → Generate TypeScript SDK

Key Endpoints to Implement
