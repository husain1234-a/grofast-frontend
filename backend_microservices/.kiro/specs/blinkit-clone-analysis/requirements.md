# Blinkit Clone Analysis - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for analyzing whether the current application is a perfect clone of Blinkit, evaluating its microservices architecture, API communication patterns, functionality completeness, and adherence to industry standards including PEP8 guidelines and FastAPI best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Architecture Analysis

**User Story:** As a technical architect, I want to evaluate the microservices architecture implementation, so that I can determine if it follows industry best practices and proper service separation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the microservices structure THEN the system SHALL have properly separated services for auth, products, cart, orders, delivery, and notifications
2. WHEN examining service communication THEN services SHALL communicate via well-defined HTTP APIs with proper error handling
3. WHEN reviewing the API Gateway THEN it SHALL properly route requests to appropriate microservices with rate limiting and CORS handling
4. IF services need to communicate THEN they SHALL use async HTTP clients with proper timeout and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN evaluating service independence THEN each service SHALL have its own database schema and business logic

### Requirement 2: Blinkit Feature Completeness

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to verify all core Blinkit features are implemented, so that the clone provides equivalent functionality to the original platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing with Blinkit THEN the system SHALL support user authentication via OTP and Google OAuth
2. WHEN evaluating product catalog THEN it SHALL include categories, search, filtering, and inventory management
3. WHEN checking cart functionality THEN it SHALL support add/remove items, quantity updates, and real-time totals
4. WHEN reviewing order management THEN it SHALL include order creation, status tracking, and delivery time estimation
5. WHEN examining delivery features THEN it SHALL support partner management, GPS tracking, and real-time location updates
6. WHEN testing notifications THEN it SHALL send push notifications for order updates and delivery status
7. WHEN reviewing admin features THEN it SHALL provide dashboard analytics, product management, and order oversight

### Requirement 3: API Communication Validation

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to ensure all microservices communicate properly, so that the system functions as a cohesive platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services make inter-service calls THEN they SHALL use proper authentication and authorization
2. WHEN API Gateway routes requests THEN it SHALL validate Firebase tokens and pass user context to services
3. WHEN services fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN services SHALL maintain data consistency and avoid race conditions
5. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use standardized request/response formats with proper error codes

### Requirement 4: Code Quality and Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a senior developer, I want to verify the code follows industry standards, so that it's maintainable and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Python code THEN it SHALL follow PEP8 guidelines for naming conventions, imports, and formatting
2. WHEN examining FastAPI implementation THEN it SHALL use proper dependency injection, async/await patterns, and Pydantic models
3. WHEN checking database operations THEN it SHALL use SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async sessions and proper connection pooling
4. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN it SHALL implement comprehensive exception handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN examining logging THEN it SHALL use structured logging with appropriate log levels and correlation IDs
6. WHEN checking security THEN it SHALL implement proper input validation, rate limiting, and authentication mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability Assessment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to evaluate the system's scalability and performance characteristics, so that it can handle production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing database design THEN it SHALL use proper indexing, foreign key constraints, and query optimization
2. WHEN reviewing caching strategy THEN it SHALL implement Redis for session data, cart items, and frequent queries
3. WHEN examining async operations THEN it SHALL use non-blocking I/O for all database and external service calls
4. WHEN checking background tasks THEN it SHALL use Celery for notifications and long-running operations
5. WHEN evaluating monitoring THEN it SHALL provide health checks, metrics collection, and structured logging

### Requirement 6: Security Implementation Review

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to verify proper security measures are implemented, so that user data and transactions are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling authentication THEN it SHALL use Firebase ID tokens with proper verification
2. WHEN processing requests THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN it SHALL use environment variables and proper secret management
4. WHEN handling CORS THEN it SHALL configure appropriate origins and headers
5. WHEN validating input THEN it SHALL use Pydantic models with proper validation rules

### Requirement 7: Testing and Documentation Coverage

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to assess the testing coverage and documentation quality, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing tests THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for business logic and integration tests for APIs
2. WHEN examining API documentation THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. WHEN checking deployment guides THEN it SHALL include Docker configurations and environment setup instructions
4. WHEN reviewing code documentation THEN it SHALL have proper docstrings and inline comments
5. WHEN evaluating examples THEN it SHALL provide sample data initialization and API usage examples
