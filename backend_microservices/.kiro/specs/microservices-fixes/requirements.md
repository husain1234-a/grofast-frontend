# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The microservices application has been successfully transformed from a monolith but contains several critical issues that prevent it from being production-ready. These issues include missing Docker configurations, hardcoded security credentials, and inconsistent environment variable usage across services. This feature addresses these gaps to make the application fully production-ready and secure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all microservices to have proper Docker configurations, so that I can deploy the entire application consistently using Docker Compose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `docker-compose up --build` THEN all 7 microservices SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN I check each service directory THEN each service SHALL have a Dockerfile
3. WHEN services start in Docker THEN they SHALL use the same Python base image and configuration pattern
4. WHEN I build the Docker images THEN the build process SHALL complete without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all hardcoded credentials removed from the codebase, so that the application is secure and follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scan the codebase THEN there SHALL be no hardcoded passwords, API keys, or secrets
2. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL read all sensitive configuration from environment variables
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN services SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
4. WHEN I review the admin endpoints THEN they SHALL use secure authentication instead of hardcoded keys

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent environment variable configuration across all services, so that deployment and configuration management is standardized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I compare docker-compose.yml and .env.template THEN the environment variable names SHALL match
2. WHEN services read configuration THEN they SHALL use the same environment variable naming convention
3. WHEN I deploy to different environments THEN I SHALL be able to use the same .env template
4. WHEN configuration is missing THEN services SHALL provide clear error messages about required variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper health checks and monitoring for all services, so that I can monitor the system health in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `/health` on any service THEN it SHALL return detailed health status including database connectivity
2. WHEN a service is unhealthy THEN the health check SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL log their configuration status (without sensitive data)
4. WHEN I check Docker health checks THEN they SHALL accurately reflect service health

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all services to follow the same code structure and configuration patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine service configurations THEN they SHALL follow the same pattern for settings management
2. WHEN services handle errors THEN they SHALL use consistent error handling patterns
3. WHEN I review logging THEN all services SHALL use the same logging configuration
4. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use the same HTTP client patterns with proper error handling
