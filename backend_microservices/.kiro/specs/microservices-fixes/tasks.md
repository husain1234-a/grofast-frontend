# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create missing Dockerfiles for all services





  - Create standardized Dockerfiles for cart-service, order-service, delivery-service, notification-service, and product-service
  - Use consistent Python base image and configuration pattern across all services
  - Ensure proper port exposure and working directory setup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Remove hardcoded security credentials
- [ ] 2.1 Fix hardcoded admin API key in API Gateway


  - Replace hardcoded "admin123" with environment variable ADMIN_API_KEY
  - Update admin route authentication to use secure environment-based key
  - Add validation for missing admin API key on startup
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [ ] 2.2 Fix hardcoded JWT secret in shared auth module
  - Remove default "super-secret-jwt-key" fallback from JWT authentication
  - Make JWT_SECRET_KEY a required environment variable
  - Add startup validation to ensure JWT secret is properly configured
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 2.3 Remove hardcoded credentials from development scripts
  - Update start-simple.py to not set hardcoded database URLs and JWT secrets
  - Remove development credential shortcuts from startup scripts
  - Ensure all scripts rely on proper environment configuration
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Standardize environment variable configuration
- [ ] 3.1 Update docker-compose.yml to use environment variables
  - Replace hardcoded database passwords with environment variable references
  - Add environment variable support for all sensitive configuration
  - Ensure consistency between docker-compose.yml and .env.template
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3.2 Update .env.template with all required variables
  - Add missing environment variables for database passwords
  - Include admin API key and other security-related variables
  - Ensure template covers all services' configuration needs
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3.3 Update service configuration classes for consistency
  - Standardize configuration loading patterns across all services
  - Ensure all services use the same environment variable naming conventions
  - Add proper validation and error handling for missing configuration
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 5.1_

- [x] 4. Enhance health checks and monitoring





- [x] 4.1 Implement comprehensive health checks for all services


  - Add database connectivity checks to health endpoints
  - Include external service dependency checks where applicable
  - Return proper HTTP status codes for healthy/unhealthy states
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 4.2 Add configuration validation on service startup


  - Implement startup validation for all required environment variables
  - Add database connection validation during service initialization
  - Provide clear error messages for configuration issues
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 2.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4.3 Update Docker health check configurations


  - Ensure Docker health checks accurately reflect service health
  - Add proper timeout and retry configurations for health checks
  - Test health check reliability across all services
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Implement consistent error handling patterns





- [x] 5.1 Standardize configuration error handling across services


  - Create base configuration classes with consistent error handling
  - Implement uniform logging patterns for configuration issues
  - Add graceful degradation for non-critical configuration
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_


- [x] 5.2 Update inter-service communication error handling

  - Implement consistent HTTP client patterns with proper error handling
  - Add timeout and retry logic for service-to-service communication
  - Ensure graceful degradation when dependent services are unavailable
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Create comprehensive testing for fixes
- [ ] 6.1 Add Docker build and configuration tests
  - Write tests to validate all Dockerfiles build successfully
  - Create tests for environment variable configuration validation
  - Add integration tests for docker-compose startup
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6.2 Add security validation tests
  - Create tests to scan for hardcoded credentials in codebase
  - Write tests to validate secure configuration loading
  - Add tests for admin authentication security
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 6.3 Add health check and monitoring tests
  - Write tests for health endpoint functionality
  - Create tests for database connectivity validation
  - Add tests for service startup configuration validation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
